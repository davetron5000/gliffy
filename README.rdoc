<em>The Gliffy API is currently in private beta.  This will be a Ruby implementation to access your Gliffy account.  In progress for the moment.</em>

I was initially going to try to do a domain-object style API, but I don't think that's a) easy and b) terribly useful.

The main problem is that each call needs to have a user token as well as some account-specific stuff, so the entire entrance
to the API needs to be on a "per-user-session" basis.  It is not clear to me how to accomplish that without some
very strange global handles and singletons, which, ultimately, might lead to a very surprising API.
